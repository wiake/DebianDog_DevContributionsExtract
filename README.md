# DebianDog_DevContributionsExtract
Some of my DebianDog contributions/mods to core system files etc.

Restructuring of debdog-installer (originally written by puppy forum member sunburnt->Terry) plus code for SD boot handling. Had to modify most of the other deb dog core files stored here accordingly, including Porteus boot initrd. 
Wrote chpupsocket in C for debiandog core system to allow puppy user temporary root user rights to tmp socket.
Modded ffconvert to work on DebianDog. Also created/modded precord, pavrecord, xhippo-mod (in C), DoMyFile, wex, scrox to work with DebianDogs (in some DD repos).
Founding admin/owner of "The DebianDog Organisation" github pages.
