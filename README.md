# DebianDog_DevContributionsExtract
Some of my DebianDog contributions/mods to core system files etc.

Restructured debdog-installer (originally written by puppy forum member sunburnt->Terry) and added code for SD boot handling. Had to modify most of the other deb dog core files stored here accordingly, including Porteus boot initrd. Also wrote secure chpupsocket in C for debiandog core system to allow puppy user temporary root user rights to tmp socket. Modded ffconvert to work on DebianDog and compiled small version of motion video capture system for DD.

Founding admin/owner of "The DebianDog Organisation" github pages.

Don't misread any of this please (or do if you want...). Most of these scripts were also heavily modified by Fred and Toni (either or both) and maybe mainly written by either or both of them - acknowledging contributions had been a sensitive area in the DebianDog world due to some lack of that. I do know Terry wrote first version of debdog-install though - not that it matters who the originator was, but polite to always give credit I feel and not just adopt another person's suggestions without named credit).
