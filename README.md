# DebianDog_DevContributionsExtract
Some of my DebianDog contributions/mods to core system files etc

Restructured debdog-installer (originally written by puppy forum member sunburst (Terry) and added code for SD boot handling. Had to modify most of the other deb dog core files stored here accordingly. Also wrote secure chpupsocket in C for debiandog core system to allow puppy user temporary root user rights to tmp socket.
