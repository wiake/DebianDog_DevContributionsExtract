# DebianDog_DevContributionsExtract
Some of my DebianDog contributions/mods to core system files etc.

Restructuring of debdog-installer (originally written by puppy forum member sunburnt->Terry) plus code for SD boot handling. Had to modify most of the other deb dog core files stored here accordingly, including Porteus boot initrd. 
Wrote chpupsocket in C for debiandog core system to allow puppy user temporary root user rights to tmp socket.
Modded ffconvert to work on DebianDog and compiled small version of motion video capture system for DD.
Founding admin/owner of "The DebianDog Organisation" github pages.
